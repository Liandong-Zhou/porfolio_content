        The 2019 report on the psychological development of Chinese left-behind
        children clearly describes the developmental dilemmas faced by Chinese
        left-behind children who are not accompanied by their parents. Bridge is
        an APP designed for left-behind family. It builds support communities
        for the parents of left-behind children, and provides them with free
        psychological counseling and open parenting classes. It also relieves
        left-behind children mental issues by improving the communication
        between them and their parents.
