        <p>Why I made this?</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Within the past two years, the epidemic has completely changed
          people's lives and made me realize how small and fragile humans are in
          front of nature. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and
          volcanic eruptions, can easily destroy the civilization that mankind
          is proud of. Today's technology is developing at a rapid pace, but
          also brings great changes to the Earth's environment. We cannot
          predict what consequences these changes will bring to us in the
          future, but we can be sure that living in harmony with nature is what
          we need. In the concept of alchemy, everything in the world is made up
          of four basic elements, representing the essence of everything. Thus,
          I hope that the viewer will have some thoughts about the relationship
          between human and nature through interacting with the four elements in
          the work. Description of Concept: an interactive installation that
          allows audiences to interact with real-time rendered scene by their
          motion. According to Alchemy, everything in existence comprises 4
          archetypal elements. These are Fire, Earth, Water and Air. The whole
          installation will be divided into four modes to present the different
          characteristics of the four elements. The audiences will enjoy the
          ability to manipulate matter.

        <p>Description of Setup:</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ideally this piece can be displayed on a large monitor which hung on a
          wall. However, using projector is currently best choice. The piece
          will be projected onto a wall. In front of the wall, I will place a
          Kinect v2 to read human movements.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Lighting: dim enough to clearly see the projection.</p>
        <p>Projection Dimension: 3.1m * 1.8m (Resolution: 1920 * 1080)</p>
        <p>Sound Equipment : NA</p>
        <p>Equipment: Laptop, Projector, Kinect V2, Charger</p>
