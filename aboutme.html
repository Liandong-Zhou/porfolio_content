        I studied Interdisciplinary computing and the arts major in the UCSD. I
        used to be a new media artist from Shenzhen, China. Through emerging
        technology as a medium, I always created generative, interactive, and
        experimental artwork. (Computational artist exploring tensions between
        ecology, technology, science and spirituality; Studying intelligence in
        nature, intelligence in machines, perception, consciousness,
        neuroscience, physics and (philosophies of) spirituality, ritual and
        religion; AI wrangler; curious philomath; Speculative Simulations & Data
        Dramatizations;)

        I am now an DIGITIAL PRODUCT DESIGNER specializing in UI/UX, currently
        studying Information Science, UX Reseach and Design track, at University
        of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am an initiative & reliable designer with
        internal aesthetics feeling. Driven by creating delightful user
        experience, I makes simple, elegant, yet bold designs. I believe that a
        good designer is a researcher. A researcher always dives deeply into a
        subject, taking field notes, collecting unique insights in order to
        eventually fall in love with what he or she wanted to learn. An
        explorative designer is able to break down visual patterns in any area
        of life and make everyone look at familiar things from a different
        angle. To know more about me, you can explore my WORKS in my porfolio.
        In my free time, I like to create generative, interactive artwork
        through emerging technology as a medium. I am also an Ultimate Frisbee
        enthusiast.
