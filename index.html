      <p>
        SUBSTANCES is an interactive installation made for UCSD ICAM SENIOR
        EXHIBITION. The installation is consist of four parts, Fire, Earth,
        Water, and Air, which are the four basic elements in the Ancient
        alchemy. In the theory of alchemy, the four basic elements make up
        everything in this world. This work hopes to give people thoughts about
        the composition of the world. When the viewer stands in front of this
        work, they can clearly feel the characteristics of the different
        elements in each mode and interact with the screen in real time.
